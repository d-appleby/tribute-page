        <p>
          Legend. Icon. GOAT. Prankster. Idol. Genius – whatever label you give
          him, Valentino Rossi deserves them all. There have been racing
          megastars who have transcended the sport before – from Duke and
          Hailwood to Agostini, Sheene and Roberts – but none have achieved the
          astounding global recognition or status of Tavullia’s most famous son.

          <li>
            After winning the championship, he was trained to ride 125cc racing
            motor bikes and in 1995, he won the Italian 125cc Championship. He
            also raced in the 125cc European Championship where he claimed the
            third position.
          </li>
          <li>
            His next move was big and ambitious i.e. he participated in the
            World Championship in 1996 in the Malaysian Grand Prix, where he
            finished 9th.
          </li>
          <li>
            However, he won the 1997 125cc World Championship held in Aprilia,
            to become the youngest rider ever to claim the championship.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 1998, he took up 250cc racing and came second in the World
            Championship which was won by Loris Capirossi.
          </li>
          <li>
            He won the 250cc World Championship held in 1999 in Aprilia, where
            he had won his first world championship title.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 2000, he signed up with Honda to race in the 500cc class and was
            mentored by Michael Doohan, a former 500 cc World Champion. He raced
            that year and finished second to Kenny Roberts, Jr.
          </li>
          <li>
            The 500 cc World Championship conducted its final race in 2001 and
            Rossi who had come second the previous year, finished first and
            claimed the championship.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 2004, he signed up with Yamaha and raced in the opening season of
            the Grand Prix in South Africa. He won the championship to become
            the first ever rider to win premier class championships in a
            sequence, representing two different manufacturers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Out of the 16 races held that season he won nine, securing the World
            Championship title for himself.
          </li>
          <li>
            The year 2005 was extremely good because he won eleven races in
            total to become the World Champion that year too.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 2006, however, he finished second to Nicky Hayden, from Honda, by
            five points. It was only the second time in his premier class racing
            career that he came second.
          </li>
          <li>
            The year 2007, was a little rough for him as he could only win four
            races owing to several technical problems. He was also injured in
            one of the races and finished third in the World Championship that
            year, his lowest achievement since his first championship win.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 2008, he regained his repute by winning the MotoGP title by
            winning nine races.
          </li>
          <li>
            The following year was also very fruitful, but in 2010, he suffered
            another injury in which he broke his leg while practicing at
            Mugello. He finished third in the championship and missed four races
            that season.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 2011, he left long time sponsor Yamaha to sign a two-year
            contract with Ducati.
          </li>
          <li>
            However, in the mid of 2012, he announced that he would go back to
            Yamaha at the end of the season.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 2005, Grand Prix motorcycle racing season, he won his 7th World
            Championship and fifth consecutive MotoGP Championship. That year he
            earned a place among the only five riders in the history of
            motorcycle racing to win premier-class title five times.
          </li>
          <li>
            As of 2013 he has won an grand total of 106 races, 80 of which are
            500cc/MotoGP championships.
          </li>
          <li>

          </li>
          <li>
            He has always ridden under the number 46 which also happens to be
